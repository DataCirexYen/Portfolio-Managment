# Portfolio-Managment

This is an exercise on how to create a portfolio testing 10,000 combinations of stocks, and finding if there was one combination that has: Better Returns than the Market Has the Same or lower Risk ALL credits for the algo to egarcia00 Page and inputs made by Lil Else Caller

Market Benchmark: We need to define what we will consider as our market benchmark. This will be the financial asset we will compare returns and risk against our portfolio, in this case S&P 500

As mentioned, this is not a tool to start your analysis on the portfolio you want to build, and is only showing what happened in the past, not trying to find what is happening in the future. The optimization power of a simple code is what really amazed me while going through this exercise, because we can map and evaluate complex decisions in a brief period
